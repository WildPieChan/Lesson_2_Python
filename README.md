# Lesson 2

## Introduction to Python (seminars)
### Homework:

<br/>
1. Write a program that accepts a real number as input and shows the sum of its digits.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
- 6782 &#8594; 23 <br/>
- 0,56 &#8594; 11 <br/>
<br/>
2. Write a program that accepts the number N as input and outputs a set of multiplication of numbers from 1 to N.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
- if N = 4, then [ 1, 2, 6, 24 ] (1, 1*2, 1*2*3, 1*2*3*4) <br/>
<br/>
3. Specify a list of n numbers in the sequence (1 + 1 / n)**n and display their sum on the screen.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
- for n = 6: (1: 4, 2: 7, 3: 10, 4: 13, 5: 16, 6: 19) <br/>
<br/>
4. Create a list of N elements filled with numbers from the interval [-N, N]. Find the multiplication of the elements at the specified positions. The positions are stored in a file file.txt there is one number in one line.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Implement a list shuffling algorithm.
